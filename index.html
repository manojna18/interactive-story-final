      <h2>Manogna Maddipatla</h2>
      <p>As a woman growing up in India in the 90s, one of my biggest fears has been lack of agency over my career. Unlike my mother and grandmother, I had access to top-notch education. But there was always the unspoken expectation that I would sideline my career to meet family responsibilities, especially after marriage.</p>
      <p>Despite growing educational opportunities, many young women from traditional Indian families continue to face these silent pressures. This data story explores whether such experiences reflect a wider societal trend and what factors drive it.</p>
      <p>I believe this story is especially pertinent today because of the number of women pursuing advanced education in India. While education gaps are closing, societal and structural barriers limit women from claiming their fair share in the workforce.</p>
      <div class="text">
        <h1>Education &#x2260 career progress</h1>
         According to 2022 data from the World Bank, more girls complete their lower secondary education in India than boys. Their enrollment in secondary education is steadily on rise, the data shows. Female students comprised 48% of the country's total enrollment in higher education in 2021-2022,  according to the  latest All India <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/news/women-comprises-48-of-overall-enrollment-in-higher-education-aishe-report-101706323112640.html">Survey</a> on Higher Education (AISHE). The following graphic shows that women enrollment in higher education is at par with men. In postgraduate education, female enrollment has been consistently above that of men. The challenge now lies in ensuring this education leads to parity also in career opportunities and financial independence for women.

			<p>While female participation in a country's economy and their invisible labor is undeniable, whether a woman takes up <b>paid</b> labor depends on multiple factors including her role in the family, traditional gender norms, discrimination and social attitudes.</p>
        
      <p>Though female participation in India's labor force has increased by about 10% from 23.3% in 2017-18, the extent of participation is still glaringly below that of men. Data from the International Labour Organization's (ILO) labor force
			survey suggests that a majority of Indian women with advanced education
			levels continue to stay out of the country's workforce, especially when
			married or cohabiting. This is in contrast with married men, who show
			higher participation levels than their unmarried counterparts.</p>

      A positive correlation between labor participation of women and their
      education or skill levels can only be seen in the urban parts of India,
      according to
      <a
        href="chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/928471/adbi-statistical-portrait-indian-female-labor-force_0.pdf"
        >a 2023 report</a
      >
      by the Asian Development Bank Institute. A majority of Indian women who
      work are from rural areas and pariticipate largely in agriculture, the
      report suggests.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gender gap, or the difference in labor participation rates between
      men and women, is significantly higher in India at 50.9%, the ILO data
      shows. This is in contrast with countries like Sweden, where the gap is as
      low as 6.3%.

      <h1>Traditional gender norms force women to choose between work and family</h1>
      <p>Women's disproportionate participation in unpaid, domestic labor and
      conservative social norms contribute to keeping them out of paid labor,
      according to reports from the ILO.</p>
			<p>Indian government's 2021-2022 Periodic Labour Force <a href="chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://dge.gov.in/dge/sites/default/files/2023-05/Female_labor_Utilization_in_India_April_2023_final__1_-pages-1-2-merged__1_.pdf">Survey</a> shows that 44.5% of female respondents stated child care and commitments in home making as the reasons for staying out of the workforce. In contrast, nearly 72% men said the reason was the decision to continue to study.</p>

      <h1>Where are the women then, if not at work?</h1>
      <p>A report published by the Ministry of labor and Employment last April says that a large portion of women aged 15 and over remains outside the labor force because of their engagement in household work. About 77% of urban women were outside the labor force in 2021-2022, of which 50.3% attended to domestic duties only.</p>
      <p>The way forward lies not only in comprehensive policy changes that ensure fair compensation and equal opportunities, but also in deliberate efforts to shift social attitudes. True progress will come when the responsibility of care and domestic work is no longer disproportionately assigned to women, and when choosing a career is not seen as incompatible with fulfilling traditional roles.</p>

      <p>Empowering women is just one half of the picture. What remains is dismantling the deeply rooted gender norms that still confine many women to farms, kitchens, and unpaid labor.</p>
